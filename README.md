## Global Population Distribution and Analysis

### Description:
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of population distribution across the world from 1960 to 2023. It visually compares population trends, regional demographics, and other key population insights for different countries and income groups.

### Key Features:
- **Historical Population Comparison:** The dashboard compares population sizes from 1960 to 2023, giving a clear view of population growth over time.
- **Country-Specific and Regional Data:** Includes detailed data for individual countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Albania) as well as regional and income-group classifications (e.g., Africa Eastern and Southern, Low & Middle Income, OECD Members).
- **Visual Representation:** Bar charts and pie charts visualize the sum of populations for different years, making it easy to see both global and regional trends.
- **Interactive Slicing:** Users can filter the data by various categories such as country name, income group, or region to view specific population statistics.

### Dashboard Components:
